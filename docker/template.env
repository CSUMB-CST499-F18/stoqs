# Environment variables to be defined for a production deployment of STOQS.
#
# The initial default settings are sufficient to do a 'docker-compose up'
# and have nginx/uwsgi/stoqs served from localhost.  In order to serve
# from a public or intranet server you will need to make changes here
# as detailed in the comments for each setting.  Note that credentials and
# secret stuff will be in this file, so you should approporiately protect
# it on your system and never check the modified file into version control!
#

# Set to false to start Django's development server in the stoqs container
# Set to true to start uwsgi in the stoqs container, having it served by the nginx container
PRODUCTION=true

# Django's DEBUG should be set to false in production so that 500 pages are returned on error
DJANGO_DEBUG=false

# Nginx template file - use other than default for special servers like stoqs.mbari.org
NGINX_TMPL=nginx.tmpl

# Name and email where error reports will be sent
# e.g. DJANGO_ADMINS=Full Name <email-with-name@example.com>,anotheremailwithoutname@example.com

# CAMPAIGNS_MODULE: Set to the python module that contains the campaigns to serve
# e.g. stoqs/mbari_campaigns.py
##CAMPAIGNS_MODULE=stoqs/mbari_campaigns.py

# STOQS_VOLS_DIR: Base volume directory on the host - If this is NFS mounted (as on Vagrant home dir)
# there will be problems, see: https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/issues/361#issuecomment-346562603
# A production server would need a more permanent location than /tmp/docker_stoqs_vols
STOQS_VOLS_DIR=/tmp/docker_stoqs_vols

# ___ Postgres/Postgis ___

# A default Docker installation provides a postgis service on host stoqs-postgis
# Change this to use another database server, e.g.: kraken.shore.mbari.org
STOQS_PGHOST=stoqs-postgis

# Port that the STOQS_PGHOST serves its postgis database from, the default is 5432
# Change this if STOQS_PGHOST serves postgis from a different port, e.g.: 5433

# POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Desired password for the super user in Postgres

# MAPSERV_SERVER_NAME: publicly accesible host name, used for MAPSERVER_HOST
# On a public server make this a literal name, e.g.: stoqs.mbari.org
# - An nginx proxy_pass makes it so that this should be the same as NGINX_SERVER_NAME
MAPSERV_SERVER_NAME=localhost

# NGINX_ variables used in nginx*.tmpl
# On a public server make this a literal name, e.g.: stoqs.mbari.org
# The CRT and KEY NAMEs match files that end in '.crt' & '.key'
# - If you are concerned about having a cert in a Docker image you may
#   want to run nginx on the machine so that you can have tighter control.
# - Self-signed localhost.crt and localhost.key are provided for initial
#   installation testing purposes.
